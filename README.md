# Hashing Utility

This is a simple little program that will compute hash values of a file.  Currrently it will compute MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.  

# Future Development Ideas

- Threading, a large file can take a few seconds and the program appears unresponsive.  
- Recursive hashing of all files and subfolders in a directory.  I have the proof of concept working for this, but threading will be a must.
- Integrate with NISRL
- Integrate with VirusTotal through their API.
